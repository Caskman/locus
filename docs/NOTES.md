# Notes

*   Consider letting the visualisation choose which bucket to view from in the account and to restrict this feature conditionally on the bootstrap step
*   Add documentation on how to build the APK by cloning the repo, ideally handled by a script to simplify the process
*   Address concurrency issues when multiple devices write to the same bucket to prevent conflicting location data (e.g., user appearing in two places at once)
