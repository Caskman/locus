# User Interface & Feedback Requirements

## 5.1. Status Indication
*   **Transparency:** The system must provide a persistent, visible indicator (e.g., notification) of its current status, including recording state, satellite lock, and unsynced buffer size.
*   **Subtle Errors:** Transient errors (e.g., temporary network loss) must be communicated unobtrusively to avoid user alarm fatigue.

## 5.2. Permissions
*   **Guidance:** The system must guide the user through the necessary permission grants (Location, Background Execution), providing clear rationale and direct links to system settings where required.
